# MGFormer üß† ‚Äî Multi-Granular Transformer for EEG-based Alzheimer's Detection

**MGFormer** is a lightweight hybrid model combining CNN, Transformer, and frequency-domain analysis to classify Alzheimer's Disease from EEG signals. It is optimized for subject-independent setups, enabling real-world applicability.

## üî¨ Overview

Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (AD) affects brain activity in subtle ways. EEG is a cost-effective and non-invasive modality for early AD detection. MGFormer offers:

- **Multi-Granular Token Encoding (MgTE)** ‚Äî temporal convolutions with multiple kernel sizes to extract localized dynamics.
- **Hybrid Feature Fusion (HFF)** ‚Äî combines self-attention, 1D CNNs, and FFT-based spectral features.
- **Subject-Independent Generalization** ‚Äî designed to work on entirely unseen subjects for robust clinical utility.

## üß± Architecture

MGFormer consists of two main components:

### 1. Multi-Granular Token Encoder (MgTE)
Extracts temporal features at multiple scales, then applies spatial convolution across EEG channels.

### 2. Hybrid Feature Fusion (HFF)
Each Transformer layer is extended with:
- Multi-head self-attention
- 1D convolution for fine-grained temporal features
- FFT feature extraction for spectral context

## üìä Performance

### Datasets:
- **FSU-AD**: 128Hz EEG, 19 channels, binary AD vs HC
- **AUT-AD**: 500Hz EEG, 19 channels, denoised, bandpass-filtered

### Accuracy:
| Dataset  | Accuracy | F1-Score | AUROC |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| AUT-AD   | **70.48%** | **70.50%** | 78.51% |
| FSU-AD   | **97.85%** | **97.84%** | 99.74% |
